## Code organization rules

### Split files before they grow past ~500 lines of production code

When a change would push a file's non-test code past ~500 lines, split it along responsibility seams before adding more. Splits must be move-only commits: no logic changes, renames, or reformatting mixed in. Keep external import paths unchanged by keeping the entrypoint file in place and re-exporting the pieces you split out into new files. Tests move together with the code they verify.

Prefer creating a new focused file over appending to the largest existing one.
